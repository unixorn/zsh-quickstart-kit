# The ZSH Starter Kit allows you to replace the curated plugins list it
# ships with with a custom one by creating a file named .zsh-quickstart-local-plugins.
#
# This is to make it easier to customize without having to maintain a separate
# fork of the starter kit.
#
# This example file duplicates the list of plugins that shipped with the
# kit as of 2020-01-01.

# keep.

# To make customizing easier, there's a .zsh-quickstart-local-plugins-example
# file at the top level of the zsh-quickstart-kit repository that you can copy
