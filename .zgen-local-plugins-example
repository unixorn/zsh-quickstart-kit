# The Zsh Starter Kit allows you to replace the curated plugins list it
# ships with with a custom one by creating a file named .zgen-local-plugins.
#
# This is to make it easier to customize without having to maintain a separate
# fork of the starter kit.
#
# This example file duplicates the list of plugins that shipped with the
# kit as of 2017-05-07.

# If you want to customize your plugin list, create a file named
# .zgen-local-plugins in your home directory. That file will be sourced
# during startup *instead* of running this load-starter-plugin-list function,
# so make sure to include everything from this function that you want to keep.

# If zsh-syntax-highlighting is bundled after zsh-history-substring-search,
# they break, so get the order right.
