# The Zsh Starter Kit allows you to replace the curated plugins list it
# ships with with a custom one by creating a file named .zgen-local-plugins.
#
# This is to make it easier to customize without having to maintain a separate
# fork of the starter kit.
#
# This example file duplicates the list of plugins that shipped with the
# kit as of 2020-01-01.

# If you want to customize your plugin list, create a file named

# during startup *instead* of running this load-starter-plugin-list function,
# so make sure to include everything from this function that you want to
# keep.
#
# To make customizing easier, there's a .zgen-local-plugins-example file
# at the top level of the zsh-quickstart-kit repository that you can copy
# as a starting point. This keeps you from having to maintain a fork of
