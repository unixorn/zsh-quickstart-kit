## Announcement

I've switched the quickstart kit to use [zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom.git) instead of zgen. This should be a painless update since zgenom is a superset of zgen.
## Installation

### Prerequisites

#### Fonts

This quickstart includes the [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) ZSH theme, which requires a Powerline-compatible font in your terminal to display certain status glyphs. Fonts that are Powerline-compatible include many useful glyphs, including the nice branch icon that the theme in this `.zshrc` uses.

Here are a few good Powerline-compatible fonts:

* [Awesome Terminal Fonts](https://github.com/gabrielelana/awesome-terminal-fonts) - A family of fonts that includes some nice monospaced Icons.
* [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code) - Microsoft's Cascadia Code
* [Fantasque Awesome Font](https://github.com/ztomer/fantasque_awesome_powerline) - A nice monospaced font, patched with Font-Awesome, Octoicons and Powerline-Glyphs.
* [Fira Mono](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira) - Mozilla's Fira type family.
* [Hack](http://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) - Another Powerline-compatible font designed specifically for source code and terminal usage.
* [Input Mono](https://input.djr.com/) - A family of fonts designed specifically for code. It offers both monospaced and proportional fonts and includes Powerline glyphs.
* [Iosevka](https://be5invis.github.io/Iosevka/) - Iosevka is an open source slender monospace sans-serif and slab-serif typeface inspired by [Pragmata Pro](http://www.fsd.it/fonts/pragmatapro.htm), [M+](http://mplus-fonts.osdn.jp/) and [PF DIN Mono](http://www.parachute.gr/typefaces/allfonts/din-mono-pro), designed to be the ideal font for programming.
* [Monoid](http://larsenwork.com/monoid/) - Monoid is customizable and optimized for coding with bitmap-like sharpness at 15px line-height even on low res displays.
* [Mononoki](https://madmalik.github.io/mononoki/) - Mononoki is a typeface by Matthias Tellen, created to enhance code formatting.
* [Nerd fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) - A collection of over 20 patched fonts (over 1,700 variations) & the fontforge font patcher python script for Powerline, devicons, and vim-devicons: includes Droid Sans, Meslo, AnonymousPro, ProFont, Inconsolta, and many more.
* [Powerline patched font collection](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) - A collection of a dozen or so fonts patched to include Powerline glyphs.
* [Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/) - Victor Mono is a free programming font with semi-connected cursive italics, symbol ligatures (!=, ->>, =>, ===, <=, >=, ++) and Latin, Cyrillic and Greek characters.
* [spacemono](https://github.com/googlefonts/spacemono) - Google's new original monospace display typeface family.

### OS-specific setup

#### fzf

You'll need to install [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/) to enable the enhanced history search. Manual install instructions can be found at [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), and os-specific instructions below.

#### macOS

1. Download iTerm2 from [http://www.iterm2.com](http://www.iterm2.com) (optional). In my opinion it is considerably nicer than the stock Terminal application that comes with macOS. Please note - there is an RCE flaw in all versions of iTerm 2 before 3.3.6, so update if you're using an affected version.
2. Install the current version of Homebrew from [http://brew.sh/](http://brew.sh/).
3. Install GNU Stow with `brew install stow`
4. Homebrew has a newer version of `zsh` than the one Apple shipped with the OS before 11.6, so `brew install zsh` to install it.
5. Switch your shell to `zsh` if necessary - Apple has defaulted the shell for new users to `zsh` since macOS Catalina (10.15):
    1. System Preferences -> Users & Groups.
    2. Unlock the preferences
    3. Select your user
    4. Select advanced options
    5. Set your login shell to `/bin/zsh` (or `/usr/local/bin/zsh` if you decided to use the version packaged by `brew`)
6. Install some Powerline-compatible or NerdFont fonts from one of the links in the Fonts section above.
    1. In iTerm 2, go to Preferences->Profile in your iTerm 2 preferences, then select one of the Powerline-compatible fonts you just installed.
    2. **Make sure you also specify a Powerline-compatible font for non-ASCII in your iTerm 2 preferences or the prompt separators and branch glyphs will show up garbled**.
7. Install `fzf` with `brew install fzf`

#### Linux

1. Switch your shell to `zsh` with `chsh -s /bin/zsh`
2. Install GNU Stow - `sudo yum install -y stow` on Red Hat / CentOS systems, `sudo apt-get -y install stow` on Debian / Ubuntu.
3. Install `fzf` - `sudo apt-get install -y fzf` on Debian / Ubuntu, do a manual install on Red Hat / Centos - instructions are at [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).
4. Install the patched font in a valid X font path. Valid font paths can be listed with `xset q`: `mv YourChosenPowerlineFont.otf ~/.fonts`
5. Update the font cache for the path the font was installed in (root privileges may be needed for updating the font cache for some paths): `fc-cache -vf ~/.fonts/`

After installing a Nerdfont or Powerline-compatible font, you will need to configure your terminal emulator to use your selected Powerline-compatible font. The name of the correct font usually ends with *for Powerline*.

If the Powerline symbols cannot be seen, try closing all instances of the terminal emulator. The X Server may also need to be restarted for the new font to load correctly.

If you still can’t see the new fonts, double-check that the font has been installed to a valid X font path.

If you get garbled branch glyphs, make sure there isn't a separate font setting for non-ASCII characters in your terminal application that you also need to set to use a Powerline-compatible font. Konsole needs to be set to use UTF-8 encoding, for example.

### Set up Zgenom and the starter kit

Now that your fonts and default shell have been set up, install [zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom.git) and the dotfiles from this starter kit repository.

1. Install [Zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom.git)
    1. `cd ~`
    2. `git clone https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom.git`
2. Install the starter kit
    1. `cd ~`
    2. `git clone git@github.com:unixorn/zsh-quickstart-kit.git`
3. Configure zsh by symlinking the `.zshrc`, `.zsh_aliases` and `.zsh-completions` from this repo into your `~`.
    1. You can do this with `stow` by:
        1. `cd zsh-quickstart-kit`
        2. `stow --target=/Users/YourUsername zsh`. Replace `/Users/YourUsername` with `/home/YourUsername` if you're on Linux. If you still have errors, symlink the files in zsh into your home directory.

The `.zshrc`, `.zsh_aliases` & `.zsh_functions` files included in this kit enable the plugins listed below.

## Contents of the kit

The zsh-quickstart-kit configures your ZSH environment so that it includes:

* Automatic periodic updates of both `zgenom` and your plugins
* Cross-session shared history so commands typed in one terminal window can be seen and searched in all your other `zsh` sessions on the same machine.
* Automatic deduplication of your command history.
* Many more tab completions, courtesy of the [zsh-users/zsh-completions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions) repository, and periodic updating to the tip of master of that repository, so you get updates to the extra tab completions.
* Supercharged command history search with [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).
* Syntax highlighting at the command line.
* Tab completion of Rakefile targets.
* Enabling [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)-compatible plugins and themes (via the [zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom.git) framework).
* Various helper functions for interacting with macOS' clipboard, audio volume, Spotlight and Quicklook. For your convenience, these will only load if you are on a macOS machine so you can use the same plugin list on any *NIX system.
* If you've installed iTerm2's shell integration, it will automatically be loaded during shell startup.

### Included plugins

* [chrissicool/zsh-256color](https://github.com/chrissicool/zsh-256color) - Sets your terminal to 256 colors if available.
* [djui/alias-tips](https://github.com/djui/alias-tips) - Warns you when you have an alias for the command you just typed, and tells you what it is.

* [RobSis/zsh-completion-generator](https://github.com/RobSis/zsh-completion-generator) - Adds a tool to generate ZSH completion functions for programs missing them by parsing their `--help` output. Note that this doesn't happen dynamically, you'll have to explicitly run it to create a completion for each command missing one.
* [sharat87/pip-app](https://github.com/sharat87/pip-app) - A set of shell functions to make it easy to install small apps and utilities distributed with `pip`.
* [skx/sysadmin-util](https://github.com/skx/sysadmin-util) - A collection of scripts useful for sysadmins.
* [srijanshetty/docker-zsh](https://github.com/srijanshetty/docker-zsh) - Adds completions for `docker`.
* [stackexchange/blackbox](https://github.com/stackexchange/blackbox) - Tom Limoncelli's tool for storing secret information in a repository with gnupg encryption, automatically decrypting as needed.
* [supercrabtree/k](https://github.com/supercrabtree/k) - `k` is a directory lister that also shows git status on files & directories.
* [unixorn/autoupdate-zgenom](https://github.com/unixorn/autoupdate-zgenom) - Adds autoupdate (for both `zgenom` itself, and your plugins) to `zgenom`.
* [unixorn/bitbucket-git-helpers](https://github.com/unixorn/bitbucket-git-helpers.plugin.zsh) - Adds `git` helper scripts for bitbucket.
* [unixorn/fzf-zsh-plugin](https://github.com/unixorn/fzf-zsh-plugin) - This enables `fzf`-powered history search.
* [unixorn/git-extra-commands](https://github.com/unixorn/git-extra-commands) - A collection of extra helper scripts for `git`.
* [unixorn/jpb.zshplugin](https://github.com/unixorn/jpb.zshplugin) - Some of my standard aliases & functions.
* [unixorn/rake-completion.zshplugin](https://github.com/unixorn/rake-completion.zshplugin) - Reads the Rakefile in the current directory so you can tab complete the Rakefile targets.
* [unixorn/tumult.plugin.zsh](https://github.com/unixorn/tumult.plugin.zsh) - Adds macOS-specific functions and scripts. This plugin only adds itself to your `$PATH` if you're running macOS to allow you to use the same plugin list on macOS and other systems.
* [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) - Adds fish-like autosuggestions to your ZSH sessions.
* [zsh-users/zsh-completions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions) - Tab completions for many more applications than come standard with ZSH.
* [zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search) - Better history search.

* chruby
* colored-man
* git
* github
* osx - this will only be loaded on macOS
* pip
* python
* rsync
* screen
* sudo
* vagrant

## Customizing the kit

### Behavior toggles

Running the following commands will toggle behavior the next time you start a shell session:

* `zsh-quickstart-disable-omz-plugins` - Makes the stock quickstart not load any of the oh-my-zsh plugins it would normally use. You can re-enable them for new shell sessions with `zsh-quickstart-enable-omz-plugins`.

* Prompt selectors - We now use the [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) prompt. I won't change the prompt out from under people without a way for them to get the old behavior, so there are commands to switch back and forth.
  * `zsh-quickstart-select-powerlevel10k` -  Switch to the [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) prompt now used as the kit's default.
  * `zsh-quickstart-select-bullet-train` - Switch back to the [bullet-train](https://github.com/caiogondim/bullet-train.zsh) prompt originally used in the kit.
* You can disable printing the list of `ssh` keys by setting `DONT_PRINT_SSH_KEY_LIST` in a file in `~/.zshrc.d`.
* `bash` prints `^C` when you're typing a command and control-c to cancel, so it is easy to see it wasn't executed. By default, ZSH doesn't print the `^C`. I like seeing the `^C`, so by default the quickstart traps `SIGINT` and prints the `^C`. You can disable this by exporting `ZSH_QUICKSTART_SKIP_TRAPINT='false'` in one of the files in `~/.zshrc.d`.

### Functions and Aliases

#### .zshrc.d

The `.zshrc` included in this kit will automatically source any files it finds in `~/.zshrc.d`.

This is to make it easy for you to add extra functions and aliases without maintaining a separate fork of this repository. It also allows you to configure the behavior of some of the plugins by setting environment variables.

The files will be sourced in alphanumeric order after loading all the plugins and I suggest you use a naming scheme of `001-onething`, `002-something-else` etc to ensure they're loaded in the order you expect.

#### zqs

As of 2021-11-13, I've added a `zqs` command to start exposing some of the tunables in a more user-friendly way. The `zqs` command has the following subcommands:

##### zqs check-for-updates

Updates the quickstart kit if it has been longer than 7 days since the last update.

##### zqs selfupdate

Force an immediate update of the quickstart kit

##### zqs update

Update the quickstart kit and all your plugins

##### zqs update-plugins

Updates all your plugins
### I like a plugin, but the aliases it installs overwrite other commands or aliases

Make a file in `~/.zshrc.d` named something like `999-reset-aliases`. Since those are loaded after all the ZSH plugins, you can add lines like `unalias xyzzy` to remove an alias named `xyzzy`. Once you've cleared all the aliases you don't want, you can add new ones with the names you prefer.

### ZSH options

The quickstart kit does an opinionated (i.e. my way) setup of ZSH options and adds some functions and aliases I like on my systems.

However, `~/.zshrc.d` is processed _after_ the quickstart sets its aliases, functions and ZSH options, so if you don't care for something as set up in the quickstart, you can override the offending item in a shell fragment file there.


### Self-update Settings

The quickstart kit will automatically check for updates every seven days. If you want to change the interval, set `QUICKSTART_KIT_REFRESH_IN_DAYS` in a file in `~/.zshrc.d`. If you want to disable self updating entirely, add `unset QUICKSTART_KIT_REFRESH_IN_DAYS` in a file in `~/.zshrc.d`.

### Changing the plugin list

I've included what I think is a good starter set of ZSH plugins in this repository. However, everyone has their own preferences for their own environment.

To make the list easier to customize without having to maintain a separate fork of the quickstart kit, if you create a file named `~/.zsh-quickstart-local-plugins`, the `.zshrc` from this starter kit will source that **instead** of running the `load-starter-plugin-list` function defined in `~/.zgen-setup`.

**Using `~/.zsh-quickstart-local-plugins` is not additive, it will _completely replace_ the kit-provided list of plugins.**

I realize that it would be a pain to create `.zsh-quickstart-local-plugins` from scratch, so to make customizing your plugins easier, I've included a `.zsh-quickstart-local-plugins-example` file at the root of the repository that will install the same plugin list that the kit does by default that you can use as a starting point for your own customizations.

Copy that to your `$HOME/.zsh-quickstart-local-plugins`, change the list and the next time you start a terminal session you'll get your plugin list loaded instead of the kit's defaults.

### Disabling zmv

The quickstart automatically autoloads zmv. If you want to disable that, create a file named `.zsh-quickstart-no-zmv` in your home directory.

### Disabling oh-my-zsh

If you don't want `zgenom` to load the oh-my-zsh defaults, create `.zsh-quickstart-no-omz` in your home directory.

## FAQ

### How do I reconfigure the prompt?

You may want to reconfigure your prompt after using it. The quickstart uses the [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme, so you can reconfigure your prompt by running `p10k configure`.

### I added a new completion plugin and it isn't working

I've had reports that sometimes you need to reset your completions after adding a new plugin.

```sh
rm ~/.zcompdump*
compinit
```

### I get a git error when I try to update the kit

You try to update the kit and you get an error similar to this:

```sh
From https://github.com/unixorn/zsh-quickstart-kit
0c5bad9..2064c6b master -> origin/master

    755f689...e3f8677 switch-to-zgenom -> origin/switch-to-zgenom (forced update)
    Updating 0c5bad9..2064c6b
    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:
    zsh/.zshrc
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you merge.
    Aborting

```

This happens when you edit a file provided by the quickstart kit, in this case, `.zshrc`. This is annoying, and in order to let you customize your ZSH settings without having to maintain your own fork, the kit-provided `.zshrc` will load any files it finds in `~/.zshrc.d`.

### GNU stow complains with a warning that stowing zsh would cause conflicts

You ran `stow --target=/Users/YourUsername zsh` in the top level of the repo, and stow printed the following error:

```sh
WARNING! stowing zsh would cause conflicts:
  * existing target is neither a link nor a directory: .zshrc
All operations aborted.
```

Per @jefheaton, this is caused when trying to replace an existing `.zshrc` file. He fixed it by closing `~` in Finder so Finder wouldn't create a `.DS_Store` file, deleting the existing `.DS_Store`, and then removing the old `.zshrc`. You may have to rename it first if ZSH is keeping the file open, then delete it after closing all your Terminal/iTerm 2 windows.

### _arguments:comparguments:325: can only be called from completion function

This has been solved by running `zgen update` or switching to [zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom). New users of the kit should already be running `zgenom`. Thanks @RonanJackson for reporting the fix.

### Could not open a connection to your authentication agent

Confirm that `ssh-agent` is running. If not, Rob Montero has a good [blog post](https://rob.cr/blog/using-ssh-agent-mac-os-x/) on setting up `ssh-agent` on macOS, and here are [instructions](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/SSH_keys#Start_ssh-agent_with_systemd_user) for starting `ssh-agent` with `systemd` on Linux.
